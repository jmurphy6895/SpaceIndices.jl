#
# Function to initialize all space indices.

"""
    init(::Type{T}; kwargs...) where T<:SpaceIndexSet -> Nothing

Initialize the space index set `T`.

This function will download the remote files associated with the space index set `T` if they
do not exist or if their expiry period has been elapsed. Aftward, it will parse the files
and populate the object to be accessed by the function [`space_index`](@ref).

# Keywords

- `force_download::Bool`: If `true`, the remote files will be downloaded regardless of their
    timestamps.
    (**Default** = `false`)
- `filepaths::Union{Nothing, Vector{String}}`: If it is `nothing`, the function will
    download the space index files from the locations specified in the [`urls`](@ref)
    API function. However, the user can pass a vector with the file locations, which will be
    used instead of downloading the data. In this case, the user must provide all the files
    in the space index set `T`.
    (**Default** = `nothing`)

Initialize all the registered space index sets.

not exist or if the expiry period has been elapsed. Afterward, it will parse the files and
populate the objects to be accessed by the function [`space_index`](@ref).

If the user does not want to initialize some sets, they can pass them in the keyword
`blocklist`.
